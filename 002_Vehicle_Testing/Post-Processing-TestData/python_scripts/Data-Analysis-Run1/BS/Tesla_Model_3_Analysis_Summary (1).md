# Tesla Model 3 Data Analysis Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the analysis performed on the Tesla Model 3 running on a straight airfield, focusing on motor currents, torque, and vehicle speed relationships.

## Theoretical Expectations vs. Observations

### Motor Current and Torque
**Theoretical Expectation**:
- Torque in an electric motor is directly proportional to the current, suggesting a linear relationship.

**Observations from Scatter Plots**:
- Scatter plots showed a generally linear relationship between motor current and torque, suggesting proper motor function and sensor accuracy.

**Observations from Line Graphs**:
- Line graphs provided a clear visualization of increasing torque with increasing current, confirming the theoretical linear relationship.

### Vehicle Speed and Torque
**Theoretical Expectation**:
- Higher torque is required at lower speeds to overcome inertia; as speed increases, less torque is required.

**Observations from Scatter Plots**:
- Decrease in torque as vehicle speed increases, indicating efficient motor operation at higher speeds with reduced torque needs.

**Observations from Line Graphs**:
- The decreasing trend in torque with increased vehicle speed was clearly visible in line graphs, providing a smooth illustration of dynamic changes in torque requirements.

## Conclusions
- The data generally matches theoretical knowledge, indicating reliable sensor performance and accurate data logging. This provides a solid foundation for further detailed analysis and predictive modeling.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with regression modeling, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling to further quantify relationships and predict future performance based on current data.
