# Tesla Model 3 Data Analysis Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the analysis performed on the Tesla Model 3 running on a straight airfield, focusing on motor currents, torque, and vehicle speed relationships.

## Theoretical Expectations vs. Observations

### Motor Current and Torque
**Theoretical Expectation**:
- Torque in an electric motor is directly proportional to the current, suggesting a linear relationship.

**Observations**:
- Both the scatter plot and line graph indicated a linear relationship between motor current and torque for both front and rear motors. This consistency with theoretical expectations suggests that the sensors are functioning correctly and the data logging is accurate.

### Vehicle Speed and Torque
**Theoretical Expectation**:
- Higher torque is required at lower speeds to overcome inertia; as speed increases, less torque is required.

**Observations**:
- The line graphs showed a decreasing trend of torque as vehicle speed increases, which is consistent with less energy required to maintain speed compared to accelerating.

## Conclusions
- The data generally matches theoretical knowledge, indicating reliable sensor performance and accurate data logging. This provides a solid foundation for further detailed analysis and predictive modeling.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with regression modeling, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling to further quantify relationships and predict future performance based on current data.
